abstract: We numerically study the general valley polarization and anomalous Hall effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on monolayer jacutingaite family materials Pt2AX3 (A = Hg, Cd, Zn; X = S, Se, Te). We perform a systematic study on the atomic, electronic, and topological properties of vdW heterostructures composed of monolayer Pt2AX3 and two-dimensional ferromagnetic insulators. We show that four kinds of vdW heterostructures exhibit valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase, i.e., Pt2HgS3/NiBr2, Pt2HgSe3/CoBr2, Pt2HgSe3/NiBr2, and Pt2ZnS3/CoBr2, with a maximum valley splitting of 134.2 meV in Pt2HgSe3/NiBr2 and sizable global band gap of 58.8 meV in Pt2HgS3/NiBr2. Our findings demonstrate an ideal platform to implement applications on topological valleytronics.
