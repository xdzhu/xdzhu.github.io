abstract: Due to the stochastic formation of conductive filaments (CFs), analog resistive random-access memory (RRAM) struggles to simultaneously achieve low variability, high linearity, and symmetry in conductance tuning, thus complicating on-chip training and limiting versatility of RRAM based computing-in-memory (CIM) chips. In this study, we present a simple and effective approach using monolayer (ML) MoS2 as interlayer to control the CFs formation in TiOx switching layer. The limited S-vacancies (Sv) in MoS2–xOx interlayer can further confine the position, size, and quantity of CFs, resulting in a highly uniform and symmetrical switching behavior. The set and reset voltages (Vset and Vreset) in TiOx/MoS2–xOx based RRAM are symmetric, with cycle-to-cycle variations of 1.28% and 1.7%, respectively. Moreover, high conductance tuning linearity and 64-level switching capabilities are achieved, which facilitate high accuracy (93.02%) on-chip training. This method mitigates the device nonidealities of analog RRAM through Sv confined CFs, accelerating the development of RRAM based CIM chips.
